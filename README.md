# Google App Scripts in JavaScript

Created this repo to add some Scripts that I will be making based on some repetitve task I have to do. This way I can enhance my productivity workflow and if it's in any use case for anyone feel free to grab it and improve it based on your own needs.

This is to be used with Google Sheets.

Thank you.

## Features are simple

- Menu to run script
- UI box asking the name of the spreadsheet to backup
- It will remember the last sheet name you backup in case you added more data to it then you will just run the script to make a backup of the new data added.

-  note, if you modify old data that has been already backed up this won't be reflected in the backup sheet, as this is tailored for my needs, I need to keep old data that was already evaluated as it, however this could be updated to change  this behavior.
